## Introduction to TypeScript

TypeScript is like a cool upgrade to JavaScript made by Microsoft. It's sort of like adding extra superpowers to JavaScript without changing the fun stuff. With TypeScript, developers can tell the computer exactly what kind of things they're using in their code, so it's like giving the computer a secret decoder ring to understand the code better. It's like having a helpful robot assistant that keeps track of everything for you while you're coding, so you make fewer oopsies!

## Getting Started

Since you're in this repo, I assume you already have node.js installed in your machine, if not do it [now](https://nodejs.org/en). Install typescript globally in your machine.
 ```bash
   npm install -g typescript
   ```


## Basic Concepts

Understand the fundamental concepts of TypeScript, including variables, data types, type inference, and basic syntax.

### Type Assertion

Type assertion in TypeScript is like telling TypeScript, "Hey, trust me, I know what I'm doing with this variable's type!" It's a way for developers to explicitly inform the TypeScript compiler about the type of a variable, overriding its default type inference.

Imagine you have a variable in TypeScript, but TypeScript isn't sure of its exact type based on the context. With type assertion, you can assert or "cast" the variable to a specific type that you know it should be. This helps TypeScript understand your intentions and allows you to access properties or methods of that specific type without compiler errors.

The moment you assert a type, you can easily access the specific methods for the type. Check the 

## Type Annotations

Explore how to explicitly declare types using annotations in TypeScript and leverage static type checking.

## Functions and Interfaces

Learn about defining functions with typed parameters and return values, as well as creating interfaces to define object shapes.

## Classes and Inheritance

Discover how TypeScript supports object-oriented programming with classes, inheritance, and access modifiers.

## Advanced Topics

Dive deeper into advanced TypeScript features such as generics, decorators, namespaces/modules, and more.

## TypeScript Tooling

Explore tools and IDEs that enhance TypeScript development, including Visual Studio Code and TypeScript compiler options.

## Resources and Further Learning

Find recommended resources, articles, tutorials, and books to continue your TypeScript learning journey.
